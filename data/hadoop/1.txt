We live in the data age. It’s not easy to measure the total volume of data stored electronically,
but an IDC estimate put the size of the “digital universe” at 0.18 zettabytes
in 2006, and is forecasting a tenfold growth by 2011 to 1.8 zettabytes.* A zettabyte is
1021 bytes, or equivalently one thousand exabytes, one million petabytes, or one billion
terabytes. That’s roughly the same order of magnitude as one disk drive for every person
in the world.
This flood of data is coming from many sources. Consider the following:†
• The New York Stock Exchange generates about one terabyte of new trade data per
day.
• Facebook hosts approximately 10 billion photos, taking up one petabyte of storage.
• Ancestry.com, the genealogy site, stores around 2.5 petabytes of data.
• The Internet Archive stores around 2 petabytes of data, and is growing at a rate of
20 terabytes per month.
• The Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, Switzerland, will produce about 15
petabytes of data per year.
